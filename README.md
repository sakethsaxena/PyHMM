Installations:
  requires python2

Steps to run:

  Download the files and extract them
  use the following command to run the model:
  
  `python pyHMM.py Algined_nifH_Training.fa.txt model.json`

Known Issues:
  - some logical issues in implementation of viterbi algorithm producing erroeneous results

Still to do:
  - Fix viterbi and FA implementations 
  - make model generation more robust
